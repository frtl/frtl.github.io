For three consecutive Thursday's in July, Tampa Driver Trainer Jorge Chavez and Regional Safety Supervisor Patrick Tornwall visited the Manatee County Fire Department Training Center. They conducted training sessions on emergency response and accident recovery with petroleum tankers. Multiple groups of firefighters from municipalities around Manatee County received instruction about the safety features of gas tankers and how to safely work with an accident scene that involves a fuel spill.
