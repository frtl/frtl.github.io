---

<p>In 1962,&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc.&nbsp;entered the trucking industry as a private carrier and sales agent for&nbsp;Rock and Sand Mines. The companies eventually merged and became&nbsp;Florida Rock Industries, Inc.</p>

<p>The Orange Park, Florida, terminal was opened on March 19, 1962, under the name of&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker Hauling Sand. Ted Baker was the chief of this new venture, starting with 12 trucks and trailers.</p>

<p>Being a private carrier with the name&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc., the company couldn&rsquo;t go into Georgia, so in 1964 the name was changed to&nbsp;All Florida Sand, which was the name of the sand mines in Keystone Heights, Keuka and Interlachen, Florida.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1964,&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc.&nbsp;purchased&nbsp;Mid-State Hauling. The next year they bought&nbsp;Diamond Sand and Stone Transportation Company&nbsp;in Eustis, Florida. These two companies were merged, and the name was changed toOverland Hauling Co., Inc. with the respective trucking terminals relocated to Ocoee, Florida. Later in 1965,&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc.,&nbsp;entered into a joint venture and opened a rock quarry in southwest Georgia. With this joint venture,&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc.&nbsp;opened a trucking terminal in Blakely, Georgia, using the name&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, again as a private carrier.</p>

<p>Shortly after the purchase of&nbsp;Diamond Sand and Stone Transportation Company,&nbsp;All Florida Sand&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker&nbsp;changed their names to&nbsp;Diamond Sand and Stone Company&nbsp;and became a public carrier, hauling intrastate and interstate.</p>

<p>Until 1972, the trucking companies owned by&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc. hauled only construction aggregates and sand. However, on October 3 of that year,&nbsp;Petroleum Carrier Corporation of Florida, Inc.&nbsp;was purchased, and entry into petroleum and chemical hauling began.</p>

<p>On October 18, 1972,&nbsp;Shands &amp; Baker, Inc.&nbsp;changed its name to&nbsp;Florida Rock Industries, Inc.,&nbsp;and the transportation group,&nbsp;Diamond Sand and Stone Company,Overland Hauling Co., Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Petroleum Carrier Corporation of Florida, Inc.became a wholly owned subsidiary, taking on the name of&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.</p>

<p>In 1980,&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;purchased&nbsp;Motor Fuel Carriers, a petroleum transporter based in Panama City, Florida, with terminals in Panama City, Pensacola and Tampa, Florida, and Bainbridge, Georgia.</p>

<p>In 1986, by proxy vote of its shareholders,&nbsp;Florida Rock Industries, Inc.&nbsp;spun offFlorida Rock &amp; Tank Lines. As a result, on July 1 of that year,&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;became an independent company from&nbsp;Florida Rock Industries&nbsp;and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.</p>

<p>In 1989,&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;purchased&nbsp;J.R. Mabbett &amp; Sons, a petroleum transporter based in Griffin, Georgia, with trucking terminals in Atlanta, Macon, Columbus, Albany and Bainbridge, Georgia, and Panama City, Florida.</p>

<p>In February 1989, the public company&rsquo;s name was changed from&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;to&nbsp;FRP Properties, Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;became a subsidiary of&nbsp;FRP Properties, Inc. In August of 1992, a new flatbed company,Sunbelt Transport Inc.,&nbsp;was formed. In March of 2000, the name&nbsp;FRP Properties, Inc.&nbsp;was changed to&nbsp;Patriot Transportation Holdings, Inc.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2001,&nbsp;Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;purchased the assets ofInfinger Transportation, a petroleum and chemical transporter based in Charleston, South Carolina, and in Wilmington, North Carolina, whose operations were in many of the same cities. In 2009,&nbsp;Sunbelt Transport, Inc&nbsp;was sold by&nbsp;Patriot Transportation Holdings, Inc.</p>

<p>Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, Inc.&nbsp;has continued its growth and is an industry leader in the southeastern United States, transporting petroleum and other liquid and dry bulk commodities in tank trucks.
