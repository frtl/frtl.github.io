In 1962, Shands & Baker, Inc. entered the trucking industry as a private carrier and sales agent for Rock and Sand Mines. The companies eventually merged and became Florida Rock Industries, Inc.

The Orange Park, Florida, terminal was opened on March 19, 1962, under the name of Shands & Baker Hauling Sand. Ted Baker was the chief of this new venture, starting with 12 trucks and trailers.

Being a private carrier with the name Shands & Baker, Inc., the company couldn't go into Georgia, so in 1964 the name was changed to All Florida Sand, which was the name of the sand mines in Keystone Heights, Keuka and Interlachen, Florida.
