<h2>Driver Bonuses</h2>

<p>All FRTL company drivers are eligible to earn bonuses as recognition for periods of outstanding safety performance and in recognition of safe driving. Company drivers are able to earn bonuses quarterly and annually up to 6% of regular pay. Please contact your Terminal Manager, or refer to your driver training handbook for more details.</p>

<h2>Safe Driving Awards</h2>

<p>All drivers are recognized after completing another year of safe driving. Once a driver has reached another year of safe driving, he is given certain awards. Each year, safe driving award recipients receive an FRTL belt buckle or year numeral, certificate and years of safe driving hat. At each five-year service interval, safe drivers receive larger awards, such as a watch or a diamond ring.</p>

<h2>Spouse Awards</h2>

<p>At Florida Rock &amp; Tank Lines, we recognize that the spouses of our drivers have a very important role related&nbsp;to safety. Each day when a driver leaves for work, his/her mind must be completely focused on applying his/her skills as a professional truck driver. Encouraging their loved ones to drive safely and ensuring they get plenty of rest are just two ways that spouses support drivers daily. When drivers receive a safe-driving award, their spouses also receive a gift certificate. At each five-year safe driving interval, safe drivers&#39; spouses receive larger awards, such as a watch or a diamond bracelet.</p>
