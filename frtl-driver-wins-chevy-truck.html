title: FRTL Driver Wins Chevy Truck
---

<p>Jinder Pompeyo has been with FRLT for almost 2 years.&nbsp; He is 42 years old, married to his wife Sandra and has 3 grown children, Sabrina, Monica and Carlos.&nbsp; He came to us from a competitor for more security, better benefits and extra compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He went into training and was immediately impressed with our methods and commitment to safety.&nbsp; He learned more in a few weeks than he did in&nbsp; his entire time at the other company.&nbsp;&nbsp; He retained what he learned.&nbsp; Being safe and responsible was a great incentive to make a good living.&nbsp; He does not believe in taking chances and looks forward to a long career with FRTL.&nbsp; He likes the friendly culture in Port Ev and is always willing to help out with an extra load or extra day when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a little bit of a jokester he did not believe he had won the truck.&nbsp; What were the chances his name would be called.&nbsp; It wasn&#39;t until we asked him what color truck would he like that he realized he had won.&nbsp; He has always been proud to be a part of such a good company and winning a new truck is just icing on the cake, it reassures him that he made the correct decision to come work for FRTL.</p>
